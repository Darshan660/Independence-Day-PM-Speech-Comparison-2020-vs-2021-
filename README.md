## Overview
This project aims to analyze and compare the Independence Day speeches delivered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15th August for the years 2020 and 2021. The analysis involves preprocessing the speech text through tasks such as lowercasing, tokenization, and removal of stopwords, special characters, and punctuations. Subsequently, advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Topic Modeling, are employed to gain insights into the content and sentiments expressed in the speeches.
